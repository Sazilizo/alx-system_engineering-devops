For every additional element, why you are adding it
- The two serves are used in order not to stress on server should there be too much traffic coming in
- The load balancer's job is to evenly or appropriately distribute traffic to which ever server is available and is faster

What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
- The algorithm used is Weighted Least Connections
- It considers the servers speed and space and then distributes the traffic to whichever server can handle it and is available, providing balance

Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
-Active-Passive: because this is only a website, the two serves are capable of working with this configuration
one server is active all the time and while the other is wwaiting as a failover substitute, this does not affect traffic

How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
-it copies data from one database to another in a distributed database so users can quickly get data without interference


What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application 
A primary node is responsible for writing , quering the database
A Replica node is responsible for carrying out the operations from the primary
