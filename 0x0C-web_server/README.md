0x0C. Web server
DevOps  SysAdmin

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Tips: to test your answer Bash script, feel free to reproduce the checker environment:

start a Ubuntu 16.04 sandbox
run your script on it
see how it behaves

Tasks
0. Transfer a file to your serve

Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

Requirements:

Accepts 4 parameters
The path to the file to be transferred
The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
The username scp connects with
The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
Display Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed
scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ~/
Strict host key checking must be disabled when using scp

1. Install nginx web server
Readme:

-y on apt-get command
Web servers are the piece of software generating and serving HTML pages, let’s install one!

Requirements:

Install nginx on your web-01
server
Nginx should be listening on port 80
When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
You can’t use systemctl for restarting nginx

3. Redirection
Readme:

Replace a line with multiple lines with sed
Configure your Nginx server so that /redirect_me is redirecting to another page.

Requirements:

The redirection must be a “301 Moved Permanently”
You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Using what you did with 1-install_nginx_web_server, write 3-redirection so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
